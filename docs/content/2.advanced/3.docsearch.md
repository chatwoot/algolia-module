DocSearch provides an easy way for Open Source documentations to have an instant search on their websites!

You probably have seen it in a lot of websites with the **Cmd+K** shortcut!

Websites like [nuxtjs.org](https://nuxtjs.org), [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org) uses it to provide an instant search to users without any backend!

## Installation

As DocSearch is an additional feature for @nuxtjs/algolia-module, it needs two additional dependencies:

::code-group

  ```bash [Yarn]
  yarn add @docsearch/js @docsearch/css
  ```

  ```bash [NPM]
  npm install @docsearch/js @docsearch/css
  ```

::

## Configuration

You can easily configure DocSearch usage via the `docSearch` key in the module configuration.

By default, it is set to `false`, which disables it and does not ship anything to your Nuxt app bundle.

This key is fully typed and links you to the [DocSearch API reference](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/api) for each key.

```javascript
// nuxt.config.ts
{
  algolia: {
    apiKey: 'apiKey',
    applicationId: 'applicationId',
    // DocSearch key is used to configure DocSearch extension.
    docSearch: {
      indexName: 'indexName',
    }
  }  
}
```

You can find a list of every supported parameters by looking at the type definition ([DocSearchOptions](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/algolia/tree/main/src/types.ts)).

## Usage

You can easily add the component anywhere in your app like this:

```vue
<template>
  <AlgoliaDocSearch :options="options" />
</template>
```

`options` key is optional.

The component will try to resolve the configuration by itself via `useRuntimeConfig`.

If you want to overwrite the config from your `nuxt.config`, you can pass the object via the prop.

## Theming

If you want to theme the component, you can use these files as a reference for available variables/classes:

- [_variables.css](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/next/packages/docsearch-css/src/_variables.css)
- [button.css](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/next/packages/docsearch-css/src/button.css)
- [modal.css](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/next/packages/docsearch-css/src/modal.css)

The components gets shipped with `@docsearch/css` which is the default theme from [Algolia](https://algolia.com).
